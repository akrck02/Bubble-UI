<h1>Bubble is a modular open source UI design system.</h1>

_You can contribute to this proyect in many different ways:_

<h2> 1 - Releasing new modules:</h2>

<p>
  To develop new Bubble modules you must use the basic structure guideline explained in this file.
  We use a variable system just to make the work easy, that's why new modules have to use them.
</p>

<h3> 1.1 - Upload a new module</h3>
<p>
  New modules must be in a github repository with a "version.json" file.
  
  **The version file have the following structure:**
  <pre>
    {
        bubble: "1.0",
        name : "new_module",
        version: "1.0",
        author: "author",
        mail:"new.module.oficial@mail.com",
        github: "https://github.com/author/new_module"
    }
  </pre>
  
  The modules will be check by Bubble team and uploaded to the official server.
 </p>
 
<h3> 1.2 - Testing module issues</h3>
<p>
  Yes, you can test modules and report problems in the oficial repositories just to help the developers to solve problems!
  If you find some issues in any module just check out the "issues" tab on github and share them! 
</p>

<h2> 2 - Sharing this proyect</h2>
<p>
Bubble is a community toolkit for web development. We made it open source to make sure that all the code is always public and visible, 
that's why sharing the code to new and experienced developers its so important for our team. 
</p>

<h3> 2.1 - New developers</h3>
<p>Learning CSS? No problem. We make code easy to understand with short and self-descriptive names.</p>

<h3> 2.2 - Senior developers</h3>
<p>Okay, this is so simple for u, that's why we want you in our proyect! Just write some modules to make it better and explain the community all the possible upgrades.</p>
